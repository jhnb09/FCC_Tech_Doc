			<h2>General Description</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			The AD9512 provides a multi-output clock distribution in a
			design that emphasizes low jitter and low phase noise to
			maximize data converter performance. Other applications with
			demanding phase noise and jitter requirements can also benefit
			from this part.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are five independent clock outputs. Three outputs are
			LVPECL (1.2 GHz), and two are selectable as either LVDS
			(800 MHz) or CMOS (250 MHz) levels.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each output has a programmable divider that may be bypassed
			or set to divide by any integer up to 32. The phase of one clock
			output relative to another clock output may be varied by means
			of a divider phase select function that serves as a coarse timing
			adjustment.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the LVDS/CMOS outputs features a programmable
			delay element with a range of up to 10 ns of delay. This fine
			tuning delay block has 5-bit resolution, giving 32 possible delays
			from which to choose.
		</p>
		<p>
			The AD9512 is ideally suited for data converter clocking
			applications where maximum converter performance is
			achieved by encode signals with subpicosecond jitter.
			The AD9512 is available in a 48-lead LFCSP and can be
			operated from a single 3.3 V supply. The temperature range is
			−40°C to +85°C.
		</p>

		<header>
			<h2>POWER SUPPLY</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			The AD9512 requires a 3.3 V ± 5% power supply for V S .
			The tables in the Specifications section give the performance
			expected from the AD9512 with the power supply voltage
			within this range. The absolute maximum range of −0.3 V to
			+3.6 V, with respect to GND, must never be exceeded on
			the VS pin.
		</p>
		<p>Good engineering practice should be followed in the layout of
			power supply traces and ground plane of the PCB. The power
			supply should be bypassed on the PCB with adequate
			capacitance (>10 μF). The AD9512 should be bypassed with
			adequate capacitors (0.1 μF) at all power pins, as close as
			possible to the part. The layout of the AD9512 evaluation board
			(AD9512/PCB) is a good example.
		</p>
		<p>The AD9512 is a complex part that is programmed for its
			desired operating configuration by on-chip registers. These
			registers are not maintained over a shutdown of external power.
			This means that the registers can lose their programmed values
			if V S is lost long enough for the internal voltages to collapse.
			Careful bypassing should protect the part from memory loss
			under normal conditions. Nonetheless, it is important that the
			V S power supply not become intermittent, or the AD9512 risks
			losing its programming.
		</p>
		<p>
			The internal bias currents of the AD9512 are set by the R SET
			resistors. This resistor should be as close as possible to the value
			given as conditions in the Specifications section
			(R SET = 4.12 kΩ). This is a standard 1% resistor value and should
			be readily obtainable. The bias currents set by this resistor
			determine the logic levels and operating conditions of the
			internal blocks of the AD9512. The performance figures given
			in the Specifications section assume that this specific resistor
			value is used.

			<h2>ESD CAUTION</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			ESD (electrostatic discharge) sensitive device. Electrostatic charges as high as 4000 V readily accumulate
			on
			the human body and test equipment and can discharge without detection. Although this product features
			proprietary ESD protection circuitry, permanent damage may occur on devices subjected to high energy
			electrostatic discharges. Therefore, proper ESD precautions are recommended to avoid performance
			degradation or loss of functionality.
